Describe your application
    AS someone trying to find events near me,
    I WANT TO log into my account (authentication) to search for and save events in a website that allows me to find events happening in the North Eastern United States
    SO THAT I can save events (database), add more events or delete 
    When the page loads the events are loaded.
